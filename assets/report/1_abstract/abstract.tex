\begin{abstract}
The "Makerere Passion Fruit Disease Detection - presented by The Marconi Society Machine Learning Laboratory at Makerere University - is addressing the classification of passion fruit diseases by developing a low-cost hand-held diagnostic device which makes use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. This report details the architecture, experimentation and results of a convolutional neural network inline with this initiative. Results show that more training is needed on the presented neural network, which placed 121st in competition rankings at the time of writing.

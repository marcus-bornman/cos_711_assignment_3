\section{Conclusion(s)}
This report presented the results of using a Convolutional Neural Network - partly comprising ResNet50V2 \cite{ResNet50V2} - to identify bounding boxes and classify fruits as per the competition detailed by the "Makerere Passion Fruit Disease Detection Challenge" \cite{zindi}.

Using a simple network architecture that extends ResNet50V2 \cite{ResNet50V2} with 2 branches, the results show promise, but further research is needed with additional training emphasised as one of the shortfalls of existing experimentation. The model presented was submitted to Zindi \cite{zindi} and placed 121st in the rankings for the competition at the time of writing.
